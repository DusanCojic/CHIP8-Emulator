# CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a CHIP-8 emulator written in C++ using SDL3 for graphics. CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language used on early home computers, notably the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. The emulator allows you to run CHIP-8 games and programs, emulating the original hardware functionality on modern systems.

## Features

- Emulates the full CHIP-8 instruction set.
- Loads and runs CHIP-8 ROM files.
- Simple graphics display with a 64x32 pixel resolution.
- Keyboard input mapping to simulate the CHIP-8 keypad.
- Sound has not yet been implemented

## Architecture

The CHIP-8 architecture consists of the following components:

- **Memory:** 4KB of RAM, from 0x000 to 0xFFF, which stores the program, data, and stack. 
- **Registers:** 16 general-purpose 8-bit registers (`V0` to `VF`), used for arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Stack:** Used to store return addresses during subroutine calls. The stack can hold up to 16 return addresses.
- **Timers:** 2 8-bit timers (`delay_timer` and `sound_timer`) that decrease at 60Hz.
- **Graphics:** 64x32 pixel display for rendering the graphics. The display is monochrome (black/white).
- **Keypad:** 16 keys that simulate user input (mapped to your keyboard).

## CHIP-8 Instruction Set

Hereâ€™s the complete CHIP-8 instruction set:

## Controls

- Use the following keys to simulate the CHIP-8 keypad:

  - Z, X, C, V for `A, 0, B, F`.

### Prerequisites

- Make and g++ compiler for C++
- A CHIP-8 ROM file to test the emulator (you can find couple of ROMS in /roms folder).
    - if you download more roms, just put them in roms folder 

## Getting Started

To run the CHIP-8 emulator, do this:
```
make
